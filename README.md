# A-star-path-finding-Visualizer

This is a __python__ Application for visualizing __A-star__ path finding algorithm where users can choose souce and destination node and positions of obstacles in between.
A star algorithm is implemented from scratch using __manhattan distance__ as hueristic distance and a light weight __GUI__ is developed in __pygame__ to visualize the progress
of path finding algorithm with the final shortest path achieved. It can also be used for visualizing other path finding algorithms on a grid.

For running the tool , pygame needs to be installed if already not present. which can be done using the following commands.

### For linux/Win

> *$ pip install pygame*

### For mac 

>*$ pip3 install pygame*

or 
>*$ python -m install pygame*

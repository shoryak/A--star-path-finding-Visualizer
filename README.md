# A-star-path-finding-Visualizer

This is a python Application for visualizing A star path finding algorithm where users can choose souce and destination node and positions of obstacles in between.
A star algorithm is implemented from scratch using manhattan distance as hueristic distance and a light weight GUI is developed in pygame to visualize the progress
of path finding algorithm with the final shortest path achieved. It can also be used for visualizing other path finding algorithms on a grid.

For running the tool , pygame needs to be installed if already not present.
